So my question is, do any of you play poker online. Just wondering peoples thoughts on this. Could it ever happen? People play poker for money, why can't we play SC for money? PROS It may also increase SC's popularity I think it would be great way for pros/aspiring pros to support themselves this way.

I am interested in playing online poker with real money to try to improve my game and learn more. My question is where in the USA is the best website to go to and trust when it comes to online poker? I have been looking at ignition and ACR so far. Most of the post I find are from 2017 and later. I want to know which site currently is the most popular and trustworthy? Thanks for the feedback. I foolishly gave my word on a player so he could play in a private online club. He lost 8k and refused to pay, and is now ducking me. I'm not sure of the legality of the game (it's run in TN, I'm in NC and the guy live in GA). I'm worried that the fact that I would get a commission off his play if he had paid complicates things.

The vast majority of those who play poker over the Internet do it for real money, because the thrills of the game are considerable when there is a stake. Not winning is of course frustrating, but the prospect of emerging victorious and rounding up a bankroll is exciting enough to make the effort worthwhile. Even so, there are plenty who prefer to compete for virtual currency and Full Tilt Poker is more than happy to accommodate them. Full Tilt Poker and PokerStars have announced earlier I'm relatively new to poker and I've been studying hard. I see a lot of stories about people making good money playing poker, even making a living. Are you one of those people? How feasible is it to reliably generate cash playing?
